				<h1>About FaRCX</h2>
				<p>
					FaRCX is software for controlling LEGO&reg; Mindstorms RCX robots over the internet.
					It's written in JavaScript and PHP and runs on most Linux distributions.
					On-board video streaming is done by <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mjpg-streamer/">MJPG-streamer</a>,
					and the other video stream is an <a href="http://www.axis.com/en/products/cam_2100/index.htm">Axis 2100 Network Camera</a>.
				</p>
				<h2>History</h2>
				<p>
					FaRCX has its conceptual origins in the <a href="http://www.planetary.org/explore/projects/redrover/">Red Rover Goes to Mars</a>
					project, a joint venture between the LEGO Company and the <a href="http://planetary.org">Planetary Society</a> which took place in the early 2000s.
					As part of the project, groups of students worked with NASA and the Planetary Society to participate in the
					sending of the Spirit and Opportunity rovers to Mars, including running a contest to determine the rovers'
					names and sending a DVD containing the names of participating students to Mars with each of the rovers.
					Also part of the project was the Red Rover, Red Rover software produced by the planetary society.
					The software aimed to simulate the experience of operating a Mars rover over the internet using LEGO&reg; Mindstorms RCX robots.
					From approximately 2005 to 2011, Mars stations were hosted around the world, each allowing users to control an RCX robot
					in a different simulated Martian landscape. One such station was hosted by Linda Hamilton at Marshall University in Huntington,
					West Virginia, USA, and remained operational at the university through late 2013, during which time many people from Huntington
					and the greater world operated the rover. In December 2013, the station was moved to the residence of
					<a href="http://www.johnholbrook.us">John Holbrook</a>, and remained operational there for approximately a year.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, the site, now nearing fifteen years in operation, was rather outdated. The page layout looked as if it had been drawn
					up in 2002 (it had), and the "server" powering the site was a desktop-class Dell tower running Windows 98, which had aged somewhat.
					Towards the end of 2014, John and his friend <a href="https://github.com/G33kDude">Philip Taylor</a> began to discuss the production
					of a modernized site, written from scratch. The result, written mostly by Philip (but with John writing some of the web pages) is FaRCX,
					and control of the Rover was transferred to FaRCX, running on Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS, in January 2015.
				</p>
				<h2>Technical Overview</h2>
				<p>
					The rover is directly controlled through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms#RCX">LEGO&reg Mindstorms RCX</a> "smart brick"
					by a few cables running from it to the motors. When you press a button on the drive page, a bit of <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>
					code makes a request to a <a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a> script, telling it to move the rover. The PHP page translates this request into
					<a href="http://www.mralligator.com/rcx/opcodes.html">RCX opcodes</a> which are sent over infrared (like a TV remote) as a series of packets, as per its
					<a href="http://www.mralligator.com/rcx/protocol.html">protocol</a>. To talk with the rover, a standard LEGO&reg; USB or serial IR tower is used, the
					<a href="http://legousb.sourceforge.net/legousbtower/index.shtml">drivers</a> for which are already built into Linux kernels newer than 2.6.1.
